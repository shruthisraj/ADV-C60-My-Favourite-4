<h1> My Favourite Hobby <br> Reading!</h1>
 </section>
 <p> Books are my ultimate friends. I like spending time with them. Whether it is a mood to increase knowledge or entertainment(mostly it's entertainment) â€“ they are always available. Read as much as you want, when you want, read whatever you want. No limits, limitless topics, unlimited availability. Reading fiction stories, jokes, novels, dramas, biographies, travel stories are all interesting and informative to humans. Books are our best friends, they never deceive us.I mostly read fantasy books like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson because they give a feeling like we are IN the magical world.
